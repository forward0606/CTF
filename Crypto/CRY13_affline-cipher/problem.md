巅巅去參加國外CTF競賽,其中有一題讓她困擾不已. 你能幫她解出來嗎?

她只記得加密規則如下: for each letter of cipher text its position in the alphabet is the position of the original letter multiplied by 4 and shifted by 15 character

shift over alphabet is cyclic, so 'z' shifted by 1 is '' and '' shifted by 1 is 'a'

aplhabet consists of letters from 'a' to 'z' and symbol '_'

letter 'a' has position 0, symbol '_' has position 26 (following 'z')
